# Python-banking-system

The program simulates a simple banking system where a user can:

1. Log in to their account using a password.
2. Deposit money into their account.
3. Withdraw money from their account (if they have enough funds).
4. Check their account balance.
5. Exit the program.

How It Works:
1. Account Creation:
A bank account is created with the name "Thoukeela", password "1234", and a starting balance of $100.
2. Login:
The user is asked to enter their password. If it matches the account's password ("1234"), they can access the account features.
3. Menu Options: 
Once logged in, the user can choose to:
Deposit: Add money to the account.
Withdraw: Take money from the account (only if they have enough funds).
Check Balance: See the current balance in the account.
Exit: Quit the program.
4. Looping Until Exit:
After each action, the menu is shown again until the user chooses the "Exit" option.

Summary:
The program lets the user manage their account by logging in and performing basic banking operations (deposit, withdrawal, checkingÂ balance).
